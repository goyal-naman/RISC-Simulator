How to build
------------
For building:
	$make

For cleaning the project:
	$make clean

How to execute
--------------

$./bin/sim (Input_MEM_file_path) [0 | 1] [0 | 1 | 2]

III argument
* Optional
* 0 for Single Cycle Based
* 1 for Pipeline Based
* Default 0

IV argument
* Optional
* Specify level of prinitng
* 0 for recording .print statements
* 1 for recording accesses to Memory & updates to Register File
* 2 for recording all signals at every cycle
* Default 0


The code generates a MEMORY_OUT i.e. the complete memory at the termination of program 
and a CONTEXT_OUT i.e. complete context of processor at the termination of program.

The output contains instruction by instruction work done in each cycle in all stages namely -

1. FETCH
2. DEOCDE
3. EXECUTE
4. MEMORY ACCESS
5. WRITEBACK
