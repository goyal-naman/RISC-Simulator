Design Doc:
-----------

To design a Simple RISC Simulator in C++.

For undersatnding of Simple RISC Language refer to "Computer Organisation and Architecture" book by Dr. Sarangi, IITD. Link http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srsarangi/archbooksoft.html

                            Assembler*[2]                           RISC-Simlator*[4]
Simple RISC Program*[1]  ------------------->  Inst MEM file*[3] ---------------------->  Simulated Output*[5]


*[1] Simple RISC Program: An assembly program in Simple RISC language. Use as input to Assembler. 
     You may find sample assembly program at https://github.com/goyal-naman/architecture/tree/master/AssemblyPrograms

*[2] Assembler: Converts assemby program to Inst MEM file.
     Use the Assembler designed by Dr. Neeraj Goel, IIT-RPR. Link https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1ifefwDdR5UdjZjS1locVhBSFk

*[3] Inst MEM file: Encoded assembly instructions in hex. Generated as Assembler Ouput. Use as input to RISC-Simulator
     You may find sample Inst MEM file in "test" folder of this project/repository

*[4] RISC-Simlator: This project/repository

*[5] Simulated Output: Output of this project based on passed arguments. (Refer to How to execute section for more)

How to build
------------
For building:
	$make

For cleaning the project:
	$make clean

How to execute
--------------

$./bin/sim <arguments>

Help
-h : Display Help

Mandatory Arguments
-input [Input MEM File name] : Specify Input File
-output [Input MEM File name] : Specify Ouput File

Optional Arguments
-pipe : Use pipeline based processor
-debug [1 | 2] : Specify debug level
-mem [Memory_OUT File name] : Specify Memory_OUT File Name
-context [Context_OUT File name] : Specify Context_OUT File Name

Note
----

*Memory_OUT is the complete memory file at the termination of program 
*Context_OUT is the complete context of processor (Register Values, Flags, PC) at the termination of program.
*Please disable word wrap to see output.
*In pipeline based version the register values  are taken at begining of each cycle and displayed in hex.
*In functional based version Labels specified as relative signed integer with respect to PC in <>
 Example <-2> as label means label points to 2 instructions up from current instruction


The output contains instruction by instruction work done in each cycle in all stages namely -

1. FETCH
2. DEOCDE
3. EXECUTE
4. MEMORY ACCESS
5. WRITEBACK
